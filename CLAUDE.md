# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This repository appears to be in an early stage with minimal files:
- Contains only a `package-lock.json` file (no `package.json` yet)
- No source code directories or files present
- No existing documentation or configuration files

## Development Setup

Since this is a Node.js project (indicated by package-lock.json):
- Run `npm init` to create package.json if starting development
- Install dependencies with `npm install` once package.json exists
- Standard Node.js development practices apply

## Project Structure

The project structure has not been established yet. Common patterns for Node.js projects include:
- `src/` for source code
- `test/` or `tests/` for test files
- `lib/` for library code
- `dist/` or `build/` for compiled output

## Notes for Future Development

This CLAUDE.md should be updated as the project structure and development workflows are established.
